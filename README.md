# ART-workflow
Anthony, Reed, and Tina

In creating this repository, since we've all had experience creating a new one, we learned that there are multiple anagrams of the first letters of our first names (RAT, TAR, etc).

I learned the steps necessary to set an upstream repo.

Anthony: I learned how to set an upstream as well as a forked repository, and how to work with multiple branches. 

Anthony: I learned how to submit an issue on github. 

In part two, after cloning the repository and adding the upstream connection, I learned that I can connect my forked repository to the original repository via an upstream connection, which can allow me to push major changes back to the master branch.

In part three, I learned how to submit issues with the project.  Horray!
