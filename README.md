# ART-workflow
Anthony, Reed, and Tina

In creating this repository, since we've all had experience creating a new one, we learned that there are multiple anagrams of the first letters of our first names (RAT, TAR, etc).

Anthony: I learned how to set an upstream as well as a forked repository, and how to work with multiple branches. 

Anthony: I learned how to submit an issue on github.
