# ART-workflow
Anthony, Reed, and Tina

In creating this repository, since we've all had experience creating a new one, we learned that there are multiple anagrams of the first letters of our first names (RAT, TAR, etc).

In part two, after cloning the repository and adding the upstream connection, I learned that I can connect my forked repository to the original repository via an upstream connection, which can allow me to push major changes back to the master branch.
